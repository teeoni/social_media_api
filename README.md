## Description

This project is an API created for a thought-based social network.  I made this project to primarily test my skills with mongodb, more specifically mongoose.  I learned a lot about mongodb while making this project but still feel like I prefer mysql more. Maybe that'll change with time and more experience using mongodb, but it was still fun to work out the issues.  Whenever I make something like this I always feel like I understand more about routing, which really helps typing everything together.
